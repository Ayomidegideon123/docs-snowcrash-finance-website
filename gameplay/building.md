# Building

Players who own commercial land in MetaVoxel can build houses on their land, also they can earn $Nora by helping other players build houses. If the exterior change of a building is less than 5% within 2 years after the completion of the building, the building will be labeled "historic building". In general, the longer the buildings labeled "historic buildings" means the higher appreciation space.

Players who own buildings can create virtual companies in MetaVoxel. Billboards can also be set up for sale on the exterior of the building.
