# Open Letter 003623

In appreciation of the recent efforts of the Pizza Deliverers (SnowCrash DAO community volunteers) and the community's outstanding contributors, we decided to reward each of them with a virtual company and create initial liquidity for each virtual company's token on PancakeSwap.

For now, the types of virtual companies that are open to registration are marketing companies and mining companies.

### Marketing company

The core mission of the marketing company is to spread MetaVoxel to the world, to boost the rapid development of MetaVoxel and the entire metaverse industry.

### Mining company

The core mission of mining companies is to provide mining services for players. For example: to provide mining exchanges and training services.

Important note: at present, all virtual companies are in the stage of trial operation, and the core purpose is to make early players familiar with how virtual companies operate and reserve talents for their own virtual companies in advance. The early token economic model of a virtual company was designed by Meme MetaVoxelDAO and SnowCrash DAO.

## A few issues that $Nora holders might be concerned about

### Will the virtual company token weaken the value of $Nora?

No, on the contrary, it will increase the value of $Nora. In the whole MetaVoxel world, $Nora stands for "Power". As a community governance token, the holder of $Nora will determine how the entire MetaVoxel world works.

### When will the Pizza Deliverers’ virtual company be launched?

### When will virtual company registration be opened?

Before the launch of MetaVoxel, a small number of virtual company registrations will be opened. stay tuned for community announcements.
