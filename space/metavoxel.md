## About MetaVoxel

![](https://img.snowcrash.finance/site/docs-snowcrash-finance/MetaVoxel-PAA.014.jpeg)

> MetaVoxel is a fully decentralized world \(Metaverse\) inspired by Minecraft and constructed by infinite voxels. MetaVoxel is controlled via the DAO. Via the DAO, you decide and vote on how the world works.

In MetaVoxel, players can mine and build as much as they want. There are many islands in MetaVoxel, some of which contain large amounts of ores \(such as iron, stone, etc.\) and some rare treasures \(such as gold, diamonds, ancient fossils, etc.\). Players can use ore-making tools to build houses, or exchange for other valuable items \(of course, they can sell these ores\). There are also some islands with a beautiful environment and lots of animals and plants, which are very suitable for players to settle down, set up and operate their own virtual companies.

## Game features

### Third parties can easily access players’ game assets

As you can see, the player’s game assets \(art assets, various data, etc.\) in MetaVoxel are stored on the blockchain. This means that any third party \(digital asset trading platform, digital asset wallet, etc.\) can easily access these assets, and players can easily sell or give away these assets to other players.

Mining in MetaVoxel is almost the same as mining in the real world. There are open pit pools in the game, but more ore is buried in the mountains, underground and at the bottom of the sea. Players need to mine with the help of shovels, mining drills, explosives and other tools.

### Near infinite map

MetaVoxel has 102,400 × 102,400 × 102,400 blocks and will hardly run out of space. You can mine 51,200 blocks down, or build 51,200 blocks up.

### All kinds of terrain, all kinds of weather, various ways of playing

In MetaVoxel world, there are mountains, rivers, caves, forests, glaciers, and deserts. There is day, there is night, there is blizzard, there is fog. Players can explore, mine, build and fight all kinds of creatures here.

### Use your Meebit avatar

In MetaVoxel, Meebit holders can use their own Meebit as a MetaVoxel avatar.

Meebits is produced by Larva Labs and has 20,000 unique 3D voxel characters. As seen on the Meebits website, Owners of a Meebit are given access to an additional asset pack that include the full 3D model. Use it to render and animate your Meebit, or use as your avatar in the metaverse.

For more information about Meebits, please visit the [official website of Meebits](https://meebits.larvalabs.com/).

### Closely connected with the real world

In SnowCrash Space, we will use the phone app to get real-time data on the behavior of players in the real world, such as players’ running speed, weight, and so on. This data will be passed on to your avatar in MetaVoxel. In other words: if you want your avatar in MetaVoxel to run faster, you have to strengthen your running in the real world. What if you’re overweight in the real world? sorry that your avatar in MetaVoxel will also be overweight \(of course, you can buy “slimming props” in MetaVoxel to make yourself slimmer\).

All private data is processed with multiple encryptions.
