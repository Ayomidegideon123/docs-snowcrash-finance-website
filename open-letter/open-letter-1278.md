When it comes to marketing, we think our marketing ability (Although we haven't started marketing yet) is as good as our product development skills. So, we are clear about a few things.

1. Most blockchain projects would have to spend much more than $1 million on marketing if they wanted to reach the current market capitalization of SnowCrash DAO (Although SnowCrash DAO's market capitalization is still very low and hardly worth mentioning).
2. There are many blockchain projects that spend 80% (or even 100%) of their budget on marketing rather than product development. You know, what we're trying to say.
3. So far, we have spent $0 on marketing. Although our investors have set aside a substantial marketing budget for us.
4. **We know where money and time should be spent.**

We also know one thing, and we'll remember it for the rest of our lives.

SnowCrash DAO has achieved its current success (Though it is still a long way to our goal) because there are more than 10,000 free spirit crypto enthusiasts from all over the world who have been providing efforts and contributions. Their names are:
Adventurers, Pioneers, Hiro, Protagonist, Pizza Deliverers, $Nora holders.

## The first "Protagonist Reward"

We won't and never answer questions like "Is there any reward for participating in MetaVoxel promotion?" We hope everyone could build MetaVoxel out of love not just for profit. We believe that only love and contributions without caring much on the return, can go further and get where we want to be.

Although we didn't specify what rewards we would get for participating in building MetaVoxel, but one thing is certain: If you have ever participated in building MetaVoxel, whether you are a Pizza Deliverer who moderates SnowCrash DAO community and kept the community vibrant; software development engineers who contributed code to MetaVoxel; volunteers who provided first-class translations for SnowCrash DAO community; KOL that proactively introduced MetaVoxel to their fans; the middleman who helped SnowCrash DAO build extensive relationships with many partners in different fields; or the $Nora holder who spotted the misspelling in SnowCrash DAO official documentation and gave us timely feedback. You deserve applause and rewards.

We will implement SnowCrash DAO's first phase of "Protagonist Reward" as soon as possible. The total amount of the first "Protagonist Reward" is around $500,000 - $700,000 (Preferably $USDT or $BNB of equivalent value).

If you have been involved in building MetaVoxel, please save relevant credentials in advance (i.e. Twitter and other social media links, screenshots, etc.). Rewards will be distributed according to the contributions and credentials.

## Last but not least

1. Thank you to every Protagonist for your contributions.
2. Any waiting is worth it. $Nora holders did not let us down, is there any reason for us to disappoint $Nora holders?
