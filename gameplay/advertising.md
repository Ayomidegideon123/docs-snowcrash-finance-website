# Advertising

If you own a piece of commercial land in the MetaVoxel world, you can build houses and start your own virtual company. Of course, you can also make billboards to undertake advertising business, or sell billboard property rights to other players. There are two kinds of billboards, one is a separate outdoor billboard, which usually appears next to a building or road, and the other is a building billboard hanging on the surface of a building.

There is a limit to the number of billboards that can be set up on each piece of land. The property of outdoor independent billboard can be transferred freely. If the billboard on the building surface needs to be transferred, the property right must be transferred together with the building property right.
