# Tax

In order to ensure the steady and long-term development of SnowCrash Space, players have to pay tax on SnowCrash DAO for every transaction in MetaVoxel. It is important to note that the tax rate is not fixed and will be adjusted according to the economic environment in MetaVoxel. A year after the launch of the game, changes to the tax rate are decided by the community vote.

{% hint style="success" %}
SnowCrash DAO is a native company in SnowCrash Space and is responsible for the governance of the entire community. You can think of SnowCrash DAO as a government in the real world.
{% endhint %}

Detailed tax distribution and tax rates will be released after the official version of the game is launched.
